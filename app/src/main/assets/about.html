<h3> Intro </h3>
<ul>
    <li>The app is developed using MVP architecture.</li>
    <li>Room persistence library is used to save data in a local database. To fetch and update
        cashed data we have used Coroutines to perform background operations.
    </li>
    <li>Also, in order to read CSV data we have used Coroutines to perform background operations.</li>
    <li>The app is developed based on TDD with a proper test coverage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features: </h2>
<h3>Home screen</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Shows a list of users.</li>
    <li>If there are no cached data we will read User data from CSV file otherwise we will show
        cashed data.
    </li>
    <li>When we pull down on a list of users (Swipe-to-refresh
        gesture) we will read user data from CSV without blocking UI thread.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Orientation</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The application handles phone rotation (Portrait and Landscape).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tests</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We have implemented some Unit tests</li>
    <li>In order to test database implementation we wrote a JUnit test (Instrumented unit tests)
    </li>
